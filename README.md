# Data-dig
This is a SQL projects from Khan academy. I am going to create a data set like that, and use advanced SELECT queries to discover things about the data. 

What are average, max, and min values in the data?
What about those numbers per category in the data (using HAVING)?
What ways are there to group the data values that donâ€™t exist yet (using CASE)?
What interesting ways are there to filter the data (using AND/OR)?
